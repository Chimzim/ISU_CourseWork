/**
 * Interface for pieces used by Tetris-like games.  Each piece
 * has a position, a size, and a set of Cells.  The position is the upper-left 
 * corner of the piece's bounding box, which has a fixed size. The initial position of
 * the bounding box and the relative positions of the cells  
 * are assigned in a constructor, and thereafter the 
 * position can be modified by the shiftXXX() methods. The constructor also
 * establishes a relative ordering of the cells.  The getCells() and 
 * getCellsAbsolute methods always 
 * return the cells in this ordering, and the cycle() method always uses this ordering
 * for shifting the icons. No bounds checking is ever done in implementations of this interface; 
 * therefore, the piece position and the cell positions can have negative coordinates.
