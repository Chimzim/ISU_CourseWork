	This file is {Xinu-directory}/src/sys/sys/README

This directory contains the source programs for Xinu itself.  To rebuild
Xinu, edit file "Configuration" to reflect the hardware on your LSI 11,
and run make.  Typically, "make d" is used to make new Xinu object files,
link them into a library (libx.a), compile source program "test.c",
download the result, and invoke odt to see the output.  When you are
satisfied that it works, run "make everything" to produce miscellaneous
files like ",lint" and ",sizes" (a sample output from "make everything"
has been left in file make.out so you can see what to expect).

Finally, to make the new version public, run "make install" which actually
copies "xinu.o" and "libx.a" into {Xinu-directory}/lib where they are
accessed by cc11.

 Note1:	The make file has been carefully constructed so it references
	xinu.o and libx.a in THIS directory when it compiles and links
	the test program.  You must be careful when modifying it because
	cc11 normally references xinu.o and libx.a in the lib directory.

 Note2:	The auto-select feature of download/upload/odt assumes all LSI-11s
	have the same configuration.  No provision has been made in this
	release of the software for heterogenous LSI 11s.

 Note3: The DEQNA driver routines in this directory implement automatic
	timeout and retry to solve the imfamous DEQNA hardware bugs.  If
	your site has traded in its DEQNA boards for the new release, you
	may want to use the driver from the book, which can be found in
	directory "OLD".  You cannot mix routines from the two drivers --
	take all of them from one or the other.
